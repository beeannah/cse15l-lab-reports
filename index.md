* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home".
* The command was ran without any arguments, resulting in an output of nothing. The working directory is still "/home" since there was no argument that the current working directory would switch to.  
* Because the output printed nothing, this means that it finished with no errors.

2. *Directory* as argument

* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home"
* In this case, lecture1 is the given path that is being switched to. After the command was ran, there was no output, however there was now a "/lecture1" next to the user which signified that the current working directory is now in lecture1.
* The output is not an error.

3. *File* as argument

* When the command was ran, the working directory is still "/home/lecture1"
* After running the command, the output was "bash:  cd:  Hello.class: Not a directory". Hello.class is a file and not a directory, therefore the command was unable to switch the current working directory to Hello.class. 
* The output is an error. The cd command only takes in directories as an argument and because Hello.class is a file, the output printed out an error messages stating that Hello.class is not a directory. 

## command 2. ls
1. No argument

* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home"
* The command outputted "lecture1" after the command was ran with no argument. The working directory is "/home", so by running the command the output listed the current files and folders in home.
* The output is not an error.

2. *Directory* as argument

* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home"
* After the command was ran, the output was "Hello.class  Hello.java  **messages**  README". The command listed the current files and folders in the given path, lecture1. 
* The output is not an error

* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home/lecture1"
* The output is "Hello.java". The command listed the files and folders in the given path, which is Hello.java

* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home"
* Because there were no arguments, the command read from the terminal, resulting in a blank line as the output. By typing in the blank space, the following line outputs the entered text.
* This is not an error, by running cat without any arguments, it begins to concatenate text that is in the terminal. There is no error message displayed as well.

2. *Directory* as argument

* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home"
* The output prints out "cat: lecture1: Is a directory" for both lines. Because lecture1 is a directory, it cannot be concatenated. 
* This is an error as the cat command is only used with file contents. Lecture1 is not a file, thus the output prints an error messages stating that lecture1 is a directory. 

3. *File* as argument

* When the command was ran, the working directory is "/home/lecture1/messages"
* The output is "Hello World!" followed by a line that prints "Â¡Hola Mundo!". The command concatenated and printed the contents of en-us.txt and es-mx.txt.
* The output is not an error.
